## Logic of the Game.

1. Using react to create a memory-based game that is hosted on github pages.
2. The memory game is based on the most popular women in anime.
3. To win the game you can only click one image once. The image card id is stored in an array. If the array already includes the image ard id (clicking an image twice in a single round) will result in a loss and the current score is reset back to 0. 
4. The game also tracks the highest score you can achieve (which is 12).
